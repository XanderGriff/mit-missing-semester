- **Notes**
    - Lecture Topics:
        - Job control
        - Terminal Multiplexers
        - Dot Files
        - Working with remote machines
    - `sleep` waits for a given number of seconds
    - When we type `^C`, it sends a signal called `SIGINT`
        - There are way more signals. To find more, type `man signal` and scroll down to the signal descriptions
        - `SIGQUIT` is another one to be familiar with - similar to `SIGINT`
            - sent with `^\`
        - `SIGHUP` gets sent if there's still processes going on in the background when you close a terminal
        - `SIGSTOP` (`^Z`) will pause a program until `SIGCONT` is sent
        - `SIGKILL` cannot be captured by another process
    - Adding an `&` to the end of a terminal command will run the command in the background
        - Both suspended and running jobs can be enumerated using the `jobs` command
        - To persist a job in case you close your terminal, prefix your commands with `nohup`
        - To restart a suspended job, you can list all jobs and then use `bg %#` to restart the job that the `#` refers to in the jobs list
        - To terminate a job, you can use `kill %#`
        - To pause/suspend a job, you can use `kill -STOP %#`
    - Tmux is a terminal multiplexer that allows for convenient window manangement. Also convenient because it allows you to avoid using `nohup` hacks
    - Tmux has 3 main concepts:
        - Sessions
            - An independent workspace containing one or more windows. Kinda like a VSCode window
        - Windows
            - Kind of like a tab, can be swapped between in a given session. Visually separate parts of the same session
        - Panes
            - Like vim splits, multiple shells in the same display
    - Tmux __Session__ Commands:
        - To start a tmux session, just type `tmux` in the terminal
        - To start a new named session, run `tmux new -s NAME`
        - To list current sessions, run `tmux ls`
        - To attach to the most recent session, run `tmux a`
            - To attach to another session from the `ls`, run `tmux a -t x` where `x` is the number or name of the session
        - All tmux commands take the form of `^b x` where x is the command. Similar to VSCode chords with `Cmd-K`
    - Tmux __Window__ Commands (prefixed by `^b`)
        - `c` creates a new window. To close the window, terminate using `^d`.
        - `N` Go to the __N__th window
        - `n` Go to the next window
        - `p` Go to the previous window
        - `,` Rename the current window
        - `w` List current windows
    - Tmux __Pane__ Commands
        - `"` Split the pane with a horizontal line
        - `%`Split the pane with a vertical line
        - `<arrow key>` Move to the pane in the direction of the key pressed
        - `z` toggle zoom for current pane between split and full-screen
        - `space` rearranges the panes
